Source code for a subclassing dll, that is compatible with debugging in the VB6 IDE (especially STOP and PAUSE).
I was hoping to monetize this, so I kept the source closed. Those days have long passed, and the technique has been throughly documented.
I'm not sure what state I left the code in, so good luck!
